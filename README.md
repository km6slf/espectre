**Turn an ESP32 into a private, local Wi-Fi motion sensor.**

When someone moves through a room, they change the way Wi-Fi signals travel through it. ESPectre reads those changes and reports motion in real time. No camera, no microphone, no wearable, and no dedicated radar hardware: just a supported ESP32 and the Wi-Fi network already in the room.

**ESPectre** is an open-source platform that brings together ready-to-flash firmware, an embeddable C++ SDK, a MicroPython implementation, browser tools, a host CLI, an open dataset, open model weights, and the research workflow used to build and validate the detectors.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### ⚡ Hardware Compatibility: Macronix Flash & Modern ESPHome Support
>
> Many common ESP32-S3 boards (such as DevKitC-1 clones and N16R8 modules) ship with different SPI flash memory ICs:
> - **BoyaMicro BY25Q128** (`0x684018`): Supported by upstream 80 MHz Octal PSRAM builds.
> - **Macronix MX25L128** (`0xC22018`): Fails MSPI bus timing calibration at 80 MHz with Octal PSRAM, causing an immediate kernel boot crash and an infinite 9.1-second RTC watchdog reboot loop (`rst:0x10 (RTCWDT_RTC_RST)`).
>
> **This fork provides full hardware compatibility and bug fixes for Macronix boards:**
> 1. **Macronix 40MHz Profile (`espectre-s3-macronix.yaml`):** Configured for 40 MHz Dual I/O (DIO) Flash and internal SRAM without requiring 80 MHz Octal PSRAM.
> 2. **Automatic Storage Hardware Detection:** The CLI installer automatically probes the connected board's SPI flash manufacturer ID over serial and selects `s3-macronix` when a Macronix IC (`0xC2`) is detected.
> 3. **Modern ESPHome & ESP-IDF 5.3 Compatibility:**
>    - Fixes `get_setup_priority()` in `espectre.h` to `setup_priority::AFTER_WIFI` (preventing `ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` event loop registration failure on modern ESPHome).
>    - Replaces missing POSIX `if_indextoname` with standard ESP-IDF `esp_netif_get_netif_impl_name` in `sta_socket_helpers.cpp`.
>    - Stubs out private mDNS hook functions in `mdns_bootstrap_responder.cpp` for clean compilation against ESP-IDF 5.3.
>    - Preconfigures the **`high_accuracy`** neural-network detector for zero room calibration out of the box.

## Applications and integrations

Use ESPectre to turn on lights or a display when someone walks in, adjust heating when a room is in use, or send an alert when there is movement where nobody should be. It works with Home Assistant (through ESPHome or MQTT), appears as a standard Matter occupancy sensor, offers a local HTTP API, and can be built into your own ESP32 firmware with the C++ SDK.

Everything runs on the device: it measures the Wi-Fi channel (channel state information, or CSI) and reports motion and a movement score. Nothing needs to go to the cloud. One board covers one area, so plan on one board per room.

ESPectre detects changes in the radio environment. It does not identify people, count them, prove that a room is empty, or replace a safety-certified security, medical, or emergency system.

## Supported hardware

- ESP32-C6, ESP32-C5, ESP32-C3, ESP32-S3, ESP32-S2, and classic ESP32
- a normal Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n) network on 2.4 GHz

## Choose a firmware path

| Path | Best for | Start here |
|---|---|---|
| **Native** | Standalone sensors, MQTT integrations, including Home Assistant MQTT Discovery, and custom applications | [Native frontend](src/cpp/frontend/native/README.md) |
| **ESPHome** | Home Assistant users who want native entities, ESPHome provisioning, and Device Builder updates | [ESPHome frontend](src/cpp/frontend/esphome/README.md) |
| **Matter** | Matter controllers with occupancy-sensor support; controller validation is still limited | [Matter frontend](src/cpp/frontend/matter/README.md) |
| **Micro-ESPectre** | Lightweight sensing in MicroPython with local, read-only Direct HTTP monitoring | [Micro-ESPectre README](src/python/micro_espectre/README.md) |

## Quick start

The quickest way needs only a browser. Use desktop Chrome 151 or later; Edge can flash, but Device settings and Monitor may not work in it.

1. Open [Flash](https://espectre.dev/tools/flash/) in desktop Chrome or Edge.
2. Connect a [supported ESP32](#supported-hardware) over USB, then choose a firmware and release channel.
3. Complete on-screen Wi-Fi provisioning, or commission Matter with a supported controller.
4. Optionally, open [Device settings](https://espectre.dev/tools/device-settings/) to pin a preferred access point or set up MQTT.
5. Open [Monitor](https://espectre.dev/tools/monitor/) to watch motion, tune detection, and inspect the device.

To find your devices on the network, use **Find devices** in the browser tools or `./espectre devices`. See the [discovery reference](docs/DISCOVERY.md) for requirements and limits.

> **Matter status:** Matter support is still being tested with the different controller ecosystems. A controller that supports occupancy sensors may not have been tested with ESPectre yet.
> See [Matter controller compatibility](src/cpp/frontend/matter/README.md#matter-controller-compatibility) for the current matrix.

| Asset | What it gives you | Start here |
|---|---|---|
| **CSI dataset** | Real recordings for empty rooms, static presence, and motion, with catalog and provenance in [dataset_info.json](data/dataset_info.json) | [Data/](data/) |
| **Model weights** | Trained weights in [C++](src/cpp/core/ml_weights.h) and [Python](tools/lib/ml_weights.py), plus the training, export, and validation workflow | [ML training guide](docs/ML_TRAINING.md) |

## Security, privacy, and transparency

A sensor that can reveal presence should not be a black box. Wi-Fi sensing records no images or audio, but motion data can still reveal routines, sleep, or when nobody is home. ESPectre treats that risk as part of the design:

- motion detection is local, and cloud connectivity is not required;
- raw CSI collection is optional and meant for research and debugging;
- the [security and responsible-use guide](https://espectre.dev/security/) documents deployment boundaries, consent, data minimization, abuse reporting, and private vulnerability reporting;
- firmware releases include build-specific SBOMs, notices, and license archives so their contents can be inspected;
- the website and all browser tools are in this repository under [docs/web](docs/web/README.md), with their privacy rules and analytics policy;
- protocols, algorithms, test results, limitations, and plans are all public.

Use ESPectre only where you have the right to. Tell the people affected, get consent where required, protect access to the device and its data, and follow privacy laws.
